                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">You and your friends are visiting a new city for a tech fest. It’s late in the evening, and everyone is hungry. The group wants to find the <strong>best</strong> food place that is both <strong>affordable</strong> and <strong>highly rated</strong> — but the city is huge, and you have limited time before restaurants close.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">You need to decide which restaurant to go to and how to get there as efficiently as possible.</p>

                        <li><strong>Determining Heuristics:</strong> Students decide what “clues” they will use (e.g., shortest walking distance, highest rating, combo of both).</li>
                        <li><strong>Admissibility:</strong> They ensure their clues never underestimate the time it would take.</li>
                        <li><strong>Search Aspects:</strong> Discuss what information is worth considering (distance, rating, closing time) and what can be ignored.</li>
                        <li><strong>Optimality:</strong> Identify whether the chosen path ensures they find the best restaurant possible given constraints.</li>

                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">In engineering education, projects are gateways to deeper understanding. Over the years, I’ve observed two distinct approaches students take:</p>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Doing a Project</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">This is often task-focused. Students aim to meet requirements and "get it done." The focus sometimes drifts towards completion rather than comprehension. The outcome may look polished, but the process may not have built strong conceptual foundations.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Learning Through a Project</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">This is a mindset shift where the project is a <strong>means</strong> to explore, question, experiment, and apply knowledge. Students dig into <strong>why</strong> something works, not just how to make it work. The learning is active, hands-on, and often sticks for a lifetime because it is tied to real-world problem-solving.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Why Learning Through a Project Matters</h3>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-600">
                        <li>It develops critical thinking and the ability to troubleshoot under uncertainty.</li>
                        <li>It encourages interdisciplinary connections, mirroring industry practice.</li>
                        <li>It builds resilience, because mistakes are treated as learning opportunities.</li>
                        <li>It fosters creativity and innovation, as students often go beyond the initial brief.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4">In short, <strong>doing a project</strong> can help you pass a course, but <strong>learning through a project</strong> can prepare you for a career.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">One evening, I quickly replied to my friend’s message without thinking much. I used short, blunt words because I was busy, but my friend took it as me being angry. I didn’t notice at the time, but over the next few days, the communication reduced, and there was a gap in our friendship.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">2. Reflective Observation (What did you notice?)</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">I started noticing that my friend was not responding with the same warmth. When I looked back at the conversation, I realized my tone might have sounded rude in text form. I remembered that messages without expressions or voice can easily be misunderstood.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">3. Abstract Conceptualization (What did you learn?)</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">I learned that communication is not just about the words we use—it’s also about the tone, timing, and clarity. In text messages, especially, it’s important to be careful with how we phrase things, maybe even add context or emojis to convey feelings better. I also understood that clarifying quickly can prevent small misunderstandings from growing into bigger issues.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">4. Active Experimentation (What will you do next?)</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">Next time, I will avoid sending rushed replies when I’m busy. I will take a moment to check my tone and, if something could be misunderstood, I’ll add a few extra words to explain. If I sense any confusion, I’ll talk directly to the person—because one open conversation is better than weeks of silence.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Students were able to recall core AI topics like "Knowledge-Based Systems" and "Wumpus World Problem," though some responses were vague.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Understanding & Engagement</h3>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mb-4 text-gray-600">
                        <li>Most students reported a "Somewhat well" or "Neutral" understanding, indicating room for deeper clarity.</li>
                        <li>Engagement ratings showed a positive response from 60% of students, but one student was significantly under-engaged.</li>
                        <li>The lack of questions could mean the session was clear, or that students were hesitant to ask.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">AI-Generated Insights</h3>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mb-4 text-gray-600">
                        <li><strong>Concept Recall is Present, But Surface-Level:</strong> Students remember topic names, but detailed understanding isn't evident.</li>
                        <li><strong>Engagement Polarization:</strong> Some students were fully engaged, while at least one was under-engaged.</li>
                        <li><strong>Low Questioning = Passive Learning Risk:</strong> Lack of questions may reflect either effective clarity or low psychological safety to admit confusion.</li>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">Incorporate a 5-minute Think-Pair-Share activity at the end of the session to deepen understanding, encourage peer interaction, and naturally surface questions.</p>
